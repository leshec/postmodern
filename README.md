Copying along to get handle on basic HTMX / actix-web app

Source: [see CodeScope YouTube video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCXFi4Jg11c&t=1784s)

Make notes here on the process.

Todo:
1) favicon: Took me a while to add a Chewie Favicon. Add a credit or find an alternative.
2) finish the youtube walkthrough as is
3) figure how to deploy with shuttle
4) use it to port some of my projects
5) make some notes for later
